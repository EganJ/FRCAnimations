# Sketch Constraints
This tutorial provides a visual guide to the behavior of various constraints.

## Coincident Constraint
* Two points - the points touch each other.
* A point and a straight edge - the point is in-line with the edge. Note the point does not have to touch the edge.
* Two straight edges - the edges are in-line with each other.

## Vertical Constraint
* Straight edge - the edge becomes vertical.
* Two points - the points are vertically in line with each other.

## Horizontal Constraint
* Straight edge - the edge becomes horizontal.
* Two points - the points are horizontally in line with each other.

## Parallel Constraint
* Two straight edges - the edges become parallel.

## Perpendicular Constraint
* Two straight edges - the edges become perpendicular to each other (they are at a right angle to each other).

## Equal Constraint
* Two circular edges - the edges share the same radius.
* Two straight edges - the edges share the same length.

## Midpoint Constraint
* A point and a straight edge - the point is placed in the middle of the line.
* Three points - the middle point is placed in the middle of the two points.


## Tangent Constraint
<!-- curved edge? circle or arc? circular edge? -->
* An edge and a circular edge - the edge becomes tangent to the circular edge.


## Coincentric Constraint
* Two circular edges - the circular edges share the same center point.
